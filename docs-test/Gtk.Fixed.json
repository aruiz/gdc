It keeps\nyou from having to learn about the other GTK+ containers, but it\nresults in broken applications.  With <span data-xref=\"Gtk.Fixed\"/>, the following\nthings will result in truncated text, overlapping widgets, and\nother display bugs:</p><ul>\n<li>Themes, which may change widget sizes.</li>\n</ul><ul>\n<li>Fonts other than the one you used to write the app will of course\n  change the size of widgets containing text; keep in mind that\n  users may use a larger font because of difficulty reading the\n  default, or they may be using Windows or the framebuffer port of\n  GTK+, where different fonts are available.</li>\n</ul><ul>\n<li>Translation of text into other languages changes its size. Also,\n  display of non-English text will use a different font in many\n  cases.</li>\n</ul><p>In addition, the fixed widget can\u2019t properly be mirrored in\nright-to-left languages such as Hebrew and Arabic. i.e. normally\nGTK+ will flip the interface to put labels to the right of the\nthing they label, but it can\u2019t do that with <span data-xref=\"Gtk.Fixed\"/>. So your\napplication will not be usable in right-to-left languages.</p><p>Finally, fixed positioning makes it kind of annoying to add/remove\nGUI elements, since you have to reposition all the other\nelements. This is a long-term maintenance problem for your\napplication.</p><p>If you know none of these things are an issue for your application,\nand prefer the simplicity of <span data-xref=\"Gtk.Fixed\"/>, by all means use the\nwidget. But you should be aware of the tradeoffs.</p>",
