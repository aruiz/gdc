You can use <span data-xref=\"Gtk.Box\"/> instead, which is a\nvery quick and easy\u00a0change. If you have derived your own classes from\nGtkHBox, you can simply change the inheritance to derive directly\nfrom <span data-xref=\"Gtk.Box\"/>. No further changes are needed, since the default\nvalue of the <span data-xref=\"Gtk.Orientable-orientation\"/> property is\n<span data-xref=\"Gtk.Orientation\"/>.horizontal.\nIf you don\u2019t need first-child or last-child styling, and want your code\nto be future-proof, the recommendation is to switch to <span data-xref=\"Gtk.Grid\"/> instead\nof nested boxes. For more information about migrating to <span data-xref=\"Gtk.Grid\"/>,\nsee [Migrating from other containers to GtkGrid][gtk-migrating-GtkGrid].</p>",
